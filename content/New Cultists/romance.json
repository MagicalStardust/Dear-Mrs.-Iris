'Is this your doing?' His smile widens. #uqmarco|Marco squints his eyes at the dancers on stage, envisioning how best they would fit into a frame. Eventually, however, he begins to contemplate me.

They are enhanced, until both our sights are equally clouded. #uqmarco|Last night, I was in the kingdom of shadows. Marco and I roost in the box seats above, watching figures flicker on canvases of light and recite gramophone-grainy confessions. Afterwards, we enjoy our talks and our critiques, and after that, we enjoy each other.@"

At some point, he makes a great show of yawning to the annoyance of those in the room, but drapes his arm around me while he does. It does not leave for the rest of the night.@"

Not bad at all.' #uqedgar|Edgar operates like a well-oiled machine, and makes sure I can appreciate that. He is a dragon coiled sweetly at my foot, fiery in both his affections and his expressions of them.@"

You know, I used to dance the most when I was sorrowful,' she tells me, and then she takes my face into her hands, and shows me just how well she knew the dance. #@"

More often than not, she comes back when she notices my stunned presence. For so long she thought that if she saw others enjoying the dance of life, it would shatter her completely. I won't ever let that happen, I promise her as her heart beats in my embrace. In those moments, her beauty is breathtaking.@"
